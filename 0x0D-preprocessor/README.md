# preprocessors
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX Africa Software development. It aims to learn about how to use directives,constants and header files functions in C language.

 ## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`

* C files are written according to the `C90 standard`

* Tested on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

|Filename           |	Description                                |
--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|`0-object_like_macro.h` | Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024             |
|`1-pi.h`	| Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.                  |
|`2-main.c	`        | Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.|
|`3-function_like_macro.h`   |	Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.|
|`4-sum.h`    | Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.|
